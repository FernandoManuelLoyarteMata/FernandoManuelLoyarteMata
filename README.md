## E-commerce with online purchases.
Full development from scratch of an e-commerce with online purchases. 
This is a website for a legal cannabis seed bank, featuring functional filters, shopping carts, payment systems, and a CMS integration designed for non-specialized administrators. The design is primarily intended for desktop screens. You can visit the site at [DorianGreen](https://sativa-ebon.vercel.app/)
